    PricingCalculator   PricingService
    ConflictResolver    ConflictService
    NotificationSender  NotificationService
}

func (w *ReservationWorkflow) ProcessReservation(req ReservationRequest) (*Reservation, error) {
    // 1. Check availability
    available, err := w.AvailabilityChecker.IsAvailable(req.CourtID, req.StartTime, req.Duration)
    if err != nil || !available {
        return nil, ErrTimeSlotUnavailable
    }

    // 3. Handle conflicts with existing bookings
    conflicts, err := w.ConflictResolver.CheckConflicts(req)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // 4. Create reservation
    reservation := &Reservation{

    switch format {
    case "single_elimination":
        return generateSingleElimination(teams)
    case "double_elimination":
        return generateDoubleElimination(teams)
    case "round_robin":
        return generateRoundRobin(teams)
    default:
        return nil, ErrUnsupportedFormat
    }
}

func generateSingleElimination(teams []Team) (*TournamentBracket, error) {
    // Seed teams and create bracket structure
    seededTeams := seedTeams(teams)
    
    // Calculate number of rounds
    totalRounds := int(math.Ceil(math.Log2(float64(len(teams)))))
    
    // Generate matches for each round
    matches := make([]Match, 0)
    for round := 1; round <= totalRounds; round++ {
        roundMatches := generateRoundMatches(seededTeams, round)
        matches = append(matches, roundMatches...)
    }
    
    return &TournamentBracket{
        Format:      "single_elimination",
        Teams:       teams,
        Matches:     matches,
        TotalRounds: totalRounds,
    }, nil
}
```

### Membership Billing Cycle
```go
type MembershipBilling struct {
    MemberID     string
    PlanID       string
    BillingCycle string // "monthly", "quarterly", "annual"
    NextBillDate time.Time
    Amount       decimal.Decimal
    Status       string
}

func ProcessMembershipBilling(member *Member) error {
    billing := &MembershipBilling{
        MemberID:     member.ID,

    }
    
    // Process payment
    payment, err := processPayment(billing)
    if err != nil {
        return handlePaymentFailure(billing, err)
    }
    
    // Update membership
    member.LastBilledAt = time.Now()
    member.NextBillDate = billing.NextBillDate
    member.Status = "active"
    
    // Send receipt
    sendBillingReceipt(member, payment)

}

func (p *PricingStrategy) CalculatePrice(req PricingRequest) (*PricingResult, error) {
    basePrice := p.BasePrices[req.CourtType]
    
    // Apply time-based pricing
    if isPeakTime(req.StartTime) {
        basePrice = basePrice.Mul(p.PeakMultiplier)
    }
    
    // Apply member discount
    if req.IsMember {
        discount := basePrice.Mul(p.MemberDiscount)
        basePrice = basePrice.Sub(discount)
    }
    
    // Apply seasonal rates
    season := getSeason(req.StartTime)
    if seasonalRate, exists := p.SeasonalRates[season]; exists {
        basePrice = basePrice.Mul(seasonalRate)
    }
    
    return &PricingResult{
        BasePrice:    basePrice,
        FinalPrice:   basePrice,
        Discounts:    calculateDiscounts(req),
        Taxes:       calculateTaxes(basePrice),

        }
        return entries[i].CreatedAt.Before(entries[j].CreatedAt)
    })
    
    // Process each entry
    for _, entry := range entries {
        if isTimeSlotSuitable(entry, timeSlot) {
            // Notify user and give them time to confirm
            notifyWaitlistOpportunity(entry, timeSlot)
        }
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

    }
}

func seedByRanking(players []Player) []Player {
    // Sort players by their current ranking
    sort.Slice(players, func(i, j int) bool {
        return players[i].Ranking < players[j].Ranking
    })
    
    // Apply seeding algorithm to balance bracket
    seeded := make([]Player, len(players))
    for i, player := range players {
        seeded[calculateSeedPosition(i, len(players))] = player
    }
    
    return seeded
